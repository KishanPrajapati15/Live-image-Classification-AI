# Live image classification AI
 Live image classification using Open CV and Tkinter 
 In this project we take 2 different objects (eg: 'a' and 'b') and train the model with those objects by clicking pictures of them and feeding it to our model. After passing sufficient training data, the model can then predict on test data whether the image is 'a' or 'b'.
